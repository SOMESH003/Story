I am very happy with my life


“Two in the morning?” I grumbled in tired dispare. I look outside my balcony window to see a column of…colorful smoke?…coming from within the sea of sand. My body told me to go back to bed but my mind was on full throttle. What if it was a plane crash? What if the pilots hurt? What if there’s something valuable in the cargo? I grabbed my camera, phone, flashlight and leather bound wallet in case of an emergency with my driver’s license, ID, and name inside. Elena Smith.
